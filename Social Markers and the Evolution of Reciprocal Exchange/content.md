# Social Markers and the Evolution of Reciprocal Exchange

$public=true$

$p=93$

## Introduction

cooperative exchange
- a universal human activity
- characteristically ==delayed and indirect==

advantage of cooperation
- "tapping in to the vast reservoir of knowledge accumulated by other individuals, one can avoid having to duplicate the possibly time-consuming and dangerous trial and-error process that won that knowledge"(Pinker and Bloom 1990:712)"

viability of cooperation
- where there is ==relatedness== or ==guaranteed reciprocity== between individuals

$p=94$

cooperation in animals
- because they have an intrinsic interest in each other's survival

point of cooperation
- only if ==likelihood of meeting each other again is high enough==

biggest issue in cooperation
- size $up -> establishment of cooperation becomes more difficult [Boyd & Richerson 1988, 1989]
- individuals can achieve higher payoffs by just taking and not giving

$result "cheats"
- can go from victim to victim exploiting each and then moving on before their debt is called in

non-indiscriminacy of generalised reciprocity
- strongest with close associated and kin
- preferentially ==directed to those perceived to be within the same wider social formation==

$result language-as-an-index
- allegiances indexed -> form ==group cohesion==

$result variability of language
- stems from ability to distinguish between multiple groups

social use of language
- "construct system of verbal behaviour to ==resemble that common to the groups or groups with which [they] wish from time to time to be identified==" (LePage 1968:192)

## Methods

methodology
- computer simulation

asymmetry
- gifted point is worth more than it costs you

$p=96$

----
$widec$
four types or organisms
$/widec$
----

<span class="feature">COOP</span>
- always gives when it meets another
- has a memory to take care of cheaters

<span class="feature">CHEAT</span>
- never gives to anyone

<span class="feature">POLYGLOT</span>
- gives gifts only if the recipient has a nearly identical dialect

<span class="feature">MIMIC</span>
- like <span class="feature">cheat</span>, but changes its dialect to that of gift giver

## Results

1. population of all <span class="feature">COOP</span>s does very well
2. if there are more <span class="feature">CHEAT</span>s than memory span, cheats reign supreme
3. a population of <span class="feature">CHEAT</span>s has low wealth levels

$result ~= Dunbar 1993
- ==increasing the cognitive capacity of an organism increases the possible size of cooperating groups==
- cooperation will be more difficult if your group is bigger than your cognitive possibilities

4. <span class="feature">POLYGLOT</span> populations give rise to distinctive dialects in different regions
	- organisms in the same dialect group exchange, and therefore keep standardising their dialects
	- those in different groups cease to exchange and tend to become more different

$p=97$

$result social marking system
- most likely to become established in groups where ==like individuals are partially isolated from each other==

$p=98$

## Discussion

distinctive codes
- a way in which ==reciprocal exchange in large groups can be made more stable==
- give a "great deal" of ==honest information== about the person with whom one is dealing
- => can be used for ==evaluative purposes==

$info$
Language is not the only variable which can serve as a social marker, but it works well. It is inseparable from the person and is relatively difficult to falsify.

using and assessing language as a social marker is an adaptive psychological mechanism tied up with the very development of human exchange and communication
